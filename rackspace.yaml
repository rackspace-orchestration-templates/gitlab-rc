  use the Git version control system.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/gitlab-ce/) is an open source, web based
  application that enables users to collaborate on code.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  To access your GitLab deployment, take the IP of the GitLab server and plug
  it in your browser. By default it will redirect you to https and you'll get a
  warning since a self signed certificate is installed.

  Login with account name `root` using the password from the
  `gitlab_admin_password` output

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X
  and Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup

  Gitlab is installed using the [Gitlab Omnibus installer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)

  Full documentation is available in [the Gitlab Omnibus README file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/README.md).
